EW2 project -> Audio Amplifier
Chapter 1: Introduction and general survey. This chapter gives an overview of the economic importance, the study, and the performance requirements of power amplifiers. It also discusses the science and subjectivism in audio, and the common misconceptions about negative feedback.
Chapter 2: Power amplifier architecture and negative feedback. This chapter explains the different amplifier architectures, such as two-stage, three-stage, and four-stage, and the different amplifier classes, such as Class-A, Class-AB, Class-G, and Class-D. It also covers the advantages and disadvantages of negative feedback, and how to maximize it for stability and linearity.
Chapter 3: The general principles of power amplifiers. This chapter describes how a generic amplifier works, and what are the main distortion mechanisms that affect its performance. It also introduces the concept of the Blameless amplifier, which is a standard design that minimizes distortion before feedback.
Chapter 4 to 6: The input stage, the voltage-amplifier stage, and the output stage. These chapters cover the design and analysis of the three main stages of a conventional power amplifier, and how to optimize their linearity, noise, speed, and stability. They also compare different device types, such as BJTs and FETs, and different configurations, such as emitter-follower and complementary feedback pair.
Chapter 8: Compensation, slew rate, and stability. This chapter deals with the important issues of frequency compensation, output impedance, and amplifier stability. It shows how to design and measure the compensation network, how to minimize the output impedance, and how to avoid instability due to reactive loads or parasitic capacitance.
Chapter 17: Amplifier and loudspeaker protection. This chapter covers the various methods of protecting the amplifier and the loudspeaker from damage due to overload, DC offset, thermal stress, or short circuits. It also explains how to design and test the protection circuits, such as current limiting, relay switching, and DC detection.
